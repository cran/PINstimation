## Overview

---

This vignette describes various scenarios of creating sample datasets that fit the preferences
and needs of the users; and this for the different models. The functions in the package PINstimation
use two types of datasets: (1) A sequence of daily buys and sells (2) A high-frequency trading data.
This is the reason why only two sample datasets are preloaded with the package, namely `dailytrades`,
and `hfdata`. The users can also generate simulation data using the function `generatedata_mpin()`
for PIN, and MPIN models; and the function `generatedata_adjpin()` for the ADJPIN model. Below we
provide some scenarios of creating sample datasets both for the PIN, MPIN, and ADJPIN models.

```{r loading, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(PINstimation)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
options(crayon.enabled = TRUE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options){
  paste0(
    '<pre class="r-output"><code>',
    fansi::sgr_to_html(x = htmltools::htmlEscape(x), warn = FALSE),
    '</code></pre>'
  )
})
```
## Sample datasets for the PIN model

---

The PIN model is an multilayer PIN model with a single information layer. We can, therefore,
use the function `generatedata_mpin()`, in order to generate sample data for the PIN model.
Generically, this is done as follows:

```r
generatedata_mpin(..., layers=1)
```

If the user would like to create a sample dataset for infrequently traded stock, she can
specify low values or ranges for the trade intensity rates. For instance, let's assume
that the user suspects that an infrequently-traded stock has an average of uninformed
trading intensity for buys and sells between `300` and `500`. They generate a single 
sample dataset for this scenario as follows:


```{r sample.pin.1.1}
pindata <- generatedata_mpin(layers=1, ranges = list(eps.b=c(300, 500), eps.s=c(300,500)), verbose = FALSE)
```

The details of the generated sample dataset can be displayed with the following code
```{r sample.pin.1.2, results='markup'}
show(pindata)
```

You access the sequences of buys, and sells through the slot `@data` of the object
`pindata`.
```{r sample.pin.1.3, results='markup'}
show(pindata@data[1:10, ])
```

You can, now use the dataset object `pindata` to check the accuracy of the different 
estimation functions. You can do that by comparing the actual parameters of 
the sample datasets to the estimated parameters of the estimation functions. Let us start
with displaying the actual parameters of the sample datasets. These can be accessed
through the slot `@empiricals` of the dataset object, which stores the empirical
parameters computed from the sequences of buys and sells generated. Please refer to
the documentation of `generatedata_mpin()` for more information.

```{r sample.pin.1.4, results='markup'}
actual <- unlist(pindata@empiricals)
show(actual)
```

Estimate the PIN model using the function `pin_ea()`, and display the estimated 
parameters

```{r sample.pin.1.5, results='markup'}
model <- pin_ea(data=pindata@data, verbose = FALSE)
estimates <- model@parameters 
show(estimates)
```

Now calculate the absolute errors of the estimation method.

```{r sample.pin.1.6, results='markup'}
errors <- abs(actual - estimates)
show(errors)
```


## Sample datasets for the MPIN model

---

In contrast to the PIN model, the number of information layers is free. We can, therefore,
use the function `generatedata_mpin()` with the desired number of information layers, in 
order to generate sample data for the MPIN model. We can also skip specifying the number
of layers, and the default setting will be used: the number of layers will be randomly
selected from the integer set from `1` to `5`. Generically, this is done as follows:

```r
generatedata_mpin(...)
```

If the user would like to create a sample dataset for frequently traded stock with two
information layers, she can set the argument layers to 2, and specify high values or ranges
for the trade intensity rates. For instance, let's assume that the user suspects that a
frequently-traded stock has an average of uninformed trading intensity for buys and sells
between `12000` and `15000`. They generate a single  sample dataset for this scenario as follows:

```{r sample.mpin.1.1}
mpindata <- generatedata_mpin(layers=2, ranges = list(eps.b=c(12000, 15000), eps.s=c(12000,15000)), verbose = FALSE)
```

The details of the generated sample dataset can be displayed with the following code
```{r sample.mpin.1.2, results='markup'}
show(mpindata)
```

You access the sequences of buys, and sells through the slot `@data` of the object
`pindata`.
```{r sample.mpin.1.3, results='markup'}
show(mpindata@data[1:10, ])
```

You can, now use the dataset object `mpindata` to check the accuracy of the different 
estimation functions, namely `mpin_ml()`, and `mpin_ecm()`. You can do that by comparing
the empirical PIN value derived from the sample dataset to the estimated PIN value of 
the estimation functions. Let us start with displaying the empirical PIN value obtained
from the sample dataset. This value can be accessed through the slot `@emp.pin` of the
dataset object, which stores the empirical PIN value computed from the sequences of buys
and sells generated. Please refer to the documentation of `generatedata_mpin()` for more information.

```{r sample.mpin.1.4, results='markup'}
actualmpin <- unlist(mpindata@emp.pin)
show(actualmpin)
```

Estimate the MPIN model using the functions `mpin_ml()`, and `mpin_ecm`, and display the
estimated MPIN values.

```{r sample.mpin.1.5, results='markup'}
model_ml <- mpin_ml(data=mpindata@data, verbose = FALSE)
model_ecm <- mpin_ecm(data=mpindata@data, verbose = FALSE)
mlmpin <- model_ml@mpin
ecmpin <- model_ecm@mpin
estimates <- setNames(c(mlmpin, ecmpin), c("ML", "ECM"))
show(estimates)
```
Now calculate the absolute errors of both estimation methods.

```{r sample.mpin.1.6, results='markup'}
errors <- abs(actualmpin - estimates)
show(errors)
```
The function `generatedata_mpin()` can generate a `data.series` object that 
contains a collection of `dataset` objects. For instance, the user can generate
a collection of 10 datasets, whose data sequences span 60 days, and contain 3 
layers, and use it to check the accuracy of the MPIN estimation. 

```{r sample.mpin.1.7, results='markup'}
size <- 10
collection <- generatedata_mpin(series = size, layers = 3, verbose = FALSE)
show(collection)
```
```{r sample.mpin.1.8, results='markup'}
accuracy <- devmpin <- 0
for (i in 1:size) {
    sdata <- collection@datasets[[i]]
    model <- mpin_ml(sdata@data, xtraclusters = 3, verbose=FALSE)
    accuracy <- accuracy + (sdata@layers == model@layers)
    devmpin <- devmpin + abs(sdata@emp.pin - model@mpin)
    
}
cat('The accuracy of layer detection: ', paste0(accuracy*(100/size),"%.\n"), sep="")
cat('The average error in MPIN estimates: ', devmpin/size, ".\n", sep="")
```



## Sample datasets for the ADJPIN model

---

The AdjPIN model is an extension of the PIN model that includes the possibility of 
liquidity shocks. To obtain a sample dataset distributed according to the assumptions
of the AdjPIN model, users can use the function `generatedata_adjpin()`. Generically,
this is done as follows:

```r
generatedata_adjpin(...)
```

If the user desires to create 10 sample datasets for frequently traded stock, they can
specify high values or ranges for the trade intensity rates. For instance, let's assume
that the user suspects that a frequently-traded stock has an average of uninformed trading
intensity for buys and sells between `10000` and `15000`. 

```{r sample.adjpin.1.1}
adjpindatasets <- generatedata_adjpin(series = 10, ranges = list(eps.b=c(10000, 15000), eps.s=c(10000,15000)), verbose = FALSE)
```

The details of the generated sample data series can be displayed with the following code:
```{r sample.adjpin.1.2, results='markup'}
show(adjpindatasets)
```

You access the first dataset from `adjpindata` using this code:
```{r sample.adjpin.1.3, results='markup'}
adjpindata <- adjpindatasets@datasets[[1]]
show(adjpindata)
```

You can, now use the dataset object `adjpindata` to check the accuracy of the different 
estimation functions, namely MLE, and ECM algorithms. You can do that by comparing
the empirical adjpin, and psos values derived from the sample dataset to the estimated
adjpin, and psos values obtained from the estimation functions. Let us start with 
displaying the empirical adjpin, and psos values obtained from the sample dataset. These
values can be accessed through the slot `@emp.pin` of the dataset object, which stores 
the empirical adjpin/psos value computed from the sequences of buys and sells generated.
Please refer to the documentation of `generatedata_adjpin()` for more information.

```{r sample.adjpin.1.4, results='markup'}
actualpins <- unlist(adjpindata@emp.pin)
show(actualpins)
```

Estimate the AdjPIN model using `adjpin(method="ML")`, and `adjpin(method="ECM"`, and 
display the estimated adjpin/psos values.

```{r sample.adjpin.1.5, results='markup'}
model_ml <- adjpin(data=adjpindata@data, method = "ML", verbose = FALSE)
model_ecm <- adjpin(data=adjpindata@data, method = "ECM", verbose = FALSE)
mlpins <- c(model_ml@adjpin, model_ml@psos)
ecmpins <- c(model_ecm@adjpin, model_ecm@psos)
estimates <- rbind(mlpins, ecmpins)
colnames(estimates) <- c("adjpin", "psos")
rownames(estimates) <- c("ML", "ECM")
show(estimates)
```
Now calculate the absolute errors of both estimation methods.

```{r sample.adjpin.1.6, results='markup'}
errors <- abs(estimates - rbind(actualpins, actualpins))
show(errors)
```
