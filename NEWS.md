# NEWS - PINstimation Package

## Version 0.1.2 [20.03.2023]
----


### New Features
----
* We introduce a new function called `classify_trades()` that enables users to
classify high-frequency (HF) trades individually, without aggregating them.  
For each HF trade, the function assigns a variable that is set to `TRUE` if the
trade is buyer-initiated, or `FALSE` if it is seller-initiated.

* The `aggregate_trades()` function enables users to aggregate high-frequency
(HF) trades at different frequencies. In the previous version, HF trades were 
automatically aggregated into daily trade data. However, with the updated 
version, users can now specify the desired frequency, such as every 15 minutes.

### New Bugfixes
----
* We identified and corrected an error in the `mpin_ecm()` function. Previously,
the function would sometimes produce inconsistent results as the posterior 
distribution allowed for the existence of information layers with a probability
of zero. We have now fixed this issue and the function produces correct results.

* We have made some updates to the `mpin_ml()` function to better handle cases 
where the MPIN estimation fails for all initial parameter sets. Specifically, 
we have fixed an error in the display of the estimation results when such failure
occurs. With these updates, the function should now be able to handle such 
failures more robustly and provide appropriate feedback.

* We have simplified the ECM estimation functions, with a particular focus on
the adjpin() function. We have improved the convergence condition of the 
iterative process used in the ECM estimation. Moreover, we rounded the values
of the parameters at each iteration to a relevant number of decimals. This
shall result in a faster convergence and prevent issues with decreasing 
likelihood values.


## Version 0.1.1 [18.10.2022]
----
### New Features
----
* The functions `pin()`, `pin_*()`, `mpin_ml()`, `mpin_ecm()`, `adjpin()`,
`vpin()`, and `aggregate_trades()` accept now, for their arguments `data`,
datasets of type `matrix`. In the previous version, it only accepted
dataframes, which did not allow users, for instance, to use `rollapply()` of
the package `zoo`.

* Introduction of the function `pin_bayes()` that estimates the original pin
model using a bayesian approach as described in Griffin et al.(2021).

### Bugfixes
----
* Fixed an error in the function `initials_pin_ea()` as it used to produce
some parameter sets with negative values for trade intensity rates. The negative
trade intensity rates are set to zero.

* Fixed two errors in the function `vpin()`: (1) A bug in the calculation steps
of vpin (2) The argument `verbose` does not work properly.

* Fixed an issue with resetting the plan for the future (`future::plan`)
used for parallel processing.

## Version 0.1.0 [26.05.2022]
----
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
