PINstimation provides utilities for the estimation of probability of informed trading models:
original PIN (PIN) in Easley and O'Hara (1992) and Easley et al. (1996); multilayer
PIN (MPIN) in Ersan (2016); Adjusted PIN (AdjPIN) in Duarte and Young (2009); and volume-
synchronized PIN (VPIN) in Easley et al. (2011, 2012). Various computation methods suggested
in the literature are included. Data simulation tools and trade classification algorithms
are among the supplementary utilities. The package enables fast and precise solutions
for the sophisticated, error-prone and time-consuming estimation procedure of the probability
of informed trading measures, and it is compact in the sense detailed estimation results
can be achieved by solely the use of raw trade level data.

## New features in Version 0.1.2

* We introduce a new function called `classify_trades()` that enables users to
classify high-frequency (HF) trades individually, without aggregating them.  
For each HF trade, the function assigns a variable `isBuy` that is set to `TRUE`
if the trade is buyer-initiated, or `FALSE` if it is seller-initiated.

* The `aggregate_trades()` function enables users to aggregate high-frequency
(HF) trades at different frequencies. In the previous version, HF trades were 
automatically aggregated into daily trade data. However, with the updated 
version, users can now specify the desired frequency, such as every 15 minutes.

### Example 3: Estimate the Adjusted PIN model

We estimate the adjusted PIN model on preloaded dataset `dailytrades` using `20` initial parameter sets computed by the algorithm of Ersan and Ghachem (2022b).

```r
estimate_adjpin <- adjpin(dailytrades, initialsets = "GE")
show(estimate_adjpin)
```

estimate.vpin <- vpin(hfdata, timebarsize = 300)
show(estimate.vpin)
```

### Example 5: Estimate the AdjPIN model using aggregated high-frequency data

We use the preloaded high-frequency dataset `hfdata`, prepare it for aggregation.

```r
data <- hfdata
data$volume <- NULL
```

We classify data using the LR algorithm with a time lag of `500` milliseconds (`0.5 s`), using the function `aggregate_data()`.

```r
daytrades <- aggregate_trades(data, algorithm = "LR", timelag = 500)
```

```r
## [+] Trade classification started
##   |[=] Classification algorithm         : LR algorithm
##   |[=] Number of trades in dataset      : 100 000 trades
##   |[=] Time lag of lagged variables     : 500 milliseconds

##   |[2] Computing aggregated trades      : using lagged variables
## [+] Trade classification completed                
```

We use the obtained dataset to estimate the (adjusted) probability of informed trading via the standard Maximum-likelihood method.

```r
adjpin_ml <- adjpin(daytrades, method = "ML", initialsets = "GE")
```

```r
## [+] AdjPIN estimation started
##   |[1] Computing initial parameter sets : 20 GE initial sets generated
##   |[2] Estimating the AdjPIN model      : Maximum-likelihood Standard Estimation
##   |+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% of AdjPIN estimation completed
## [+] AdjPIN estimation completed
```

## Note to frequent users

If you are a frequent user of PINstimation, you might want to avoid repetitively
loading the package PINstimation whenever you open a new R session. You can do
that by adding PINstimation to `.R profile` either manually, or using the function
`load_pinstimation_for_good()`.

To automatically load PINstimation, run `load_pinstimation_for_good()`,
and the following code will be added to your .R profile.

```r
if (interactive()) suppressMessages(require(PINstimation))
```

After restart of the R session, PINstimation will be loaded automatically, whenever a new R
session is started. To remove the automatic loading of PINstimation, just open the
.R profile for editing `usethis::edit_r_profile()`, find the code above, and delete it.

## Contributions

The package makes a series of original contributions to the literature:

* An **efficient, user-friendly, and comprehensive implementation** of the standard models of probability of informed trading.

* A **first implementation of the estimation of the multilayer probability of informed trading (MPIN)** as developed by Ersan (2016).

* A comprehensive treatment of the **estimation of the adjusted probability of informed trading** as introduced by Duarte and Young (2009).
This includes the implementation of the factorization of the AdjPIN likelihood function, various algorithms to generate initial parameter
sets, and MLE method.

* The introduction of **the expectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm** as an alternative method to estimate the models of
probability of informed trading. The contribution is both theoretical and computational. The theoretical contribution is included in the
paper by Ghachem and Ersan (2022b). The implementation of the ECM algorithm allows the estimation of PIN, MPIN, as well as the adjusted PIN model.

* Implementation of three **layer-detection algorithms**, namely of preexistent algorithm of Ersan (2016), as well as two newly developed
algorithms, described in Ersan and Ghachem (2022a), and Ghachem and Ersan (2022b), respectively.

* A **first implementation of the estimation of the volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (VPIN)** as introduced by
Easley et al. (2011, 2012).

* **One do-it-all function for trade classification** in buyer-initiated or seller-initiated trades that implements the standard algorithms
in the field, namely `Tick`, `Quote`, `LR`, and `EMO`.
